## Getting Started

During my freshman year of high school, with the help of my graphic design
courses, I was able to develop my print and logo design skills, becoming
particularly familiar with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

After graduating, I received a cultural arts award for not only my work with the
Yearbook, but for work I completed in my courses and volunteer work for my peers
and educators as well.

## Usage

Under the `samples` directory, you'll find samples from a few of my favorite
projects during high school.
