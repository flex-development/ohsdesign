Each year the National Honor Society (NHS) sponsors the Senior Citizen Prom. As
a member of NHS, I created the invitation.

## Getting Started

The purpose of the National Honor Society (NHS) is to create enthusiasm for
scholarship, to stimulate a desire to perform service within the school and
broaden community service, to promote leadership and to develop character among
members (Constitution of NHS, Article I, Section 2).

Each year NHS sponsors the Senior Citizen Prom. During my senior year of high
school in 2016, in addition to helping execute the prom, I created the invitation.
