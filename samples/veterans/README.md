## Getting Started

Between April and May 2015, I had the opportunity to participate in Ossining
High School's 3rd Annual Living History Veterans Project.

As part of the project, the veterans also brought their medals, photographs, letters,
surplus kits, uniforms and other items they had received during their service,
to help us better understand their stories.

In April, I met with Tony and was given two weeks to create a piece of artwork
for him. Afterwards, I presented him with "Tony Warhol". Inspired by Andy Warhols
work, I wanted to visually represent a comparison of the Tony who went into the
service, and the Tony who stood before me.
