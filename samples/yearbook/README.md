## Getting Started

During my senior year, I was given the opportunity to be Yearbook Editor. My
role as Yearbook Editor was not only essential to developing my skills as a
designer, but as a team leader as well.

One of my main duties was to oversee student pages, as well as resolve any
issues that our team faced. This responsibility was key in crafting my role as a
communicator between not only my team, but other stakeholders as well.

During my time as editor, every single copy of the yearbook was sold — a feat
that hadn’t been accomplished in years, and one that I consider of my first
accomplishments as a designer.
